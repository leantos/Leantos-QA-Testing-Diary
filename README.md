## 🧠 Why This Diary?

As someone already building apps, I realized I was *unintentionally doing QA*—using DevTools, testing edge cases, and validating APIs.

This repo:
- 📖 Logs daily or weekly QA learning progress
- 🧪 Stores test artifacts like test cases, Postman collections, bug logs
- 🚀 Tracks the shift from manual → API → automation testing

---

## 🔍 Topics Covered So Far

- ✅ Manual UI Testing
- ✅ Writing structured test cases
- ✅ API testing with Postman
- 🟡 Bug Reporting formats (in progress)
- 🟡 Preparing for Selenium/Playwright automation
- 🟡 JIRA workflows (coming soon)
