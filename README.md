## 🔧 Day 1 Highlights

- Watched key QA fundamentals in the **Simplilearn Manual Testing video** (SDLC, STLC, test cases).  
- Mapped developer tasks (using DevTools, debugging) to QA terminology.  
- Created initial **manual test cases** for login flows.  
- Executed basic UI/API tests using **Chrome DevTools** and **Postman**.

_(Check the files under `manual-tests/` and `api-tests/` for details.)_

## 🎯 Goals This Week

1. **Day 2–3**: Build on manual testing — practice **bug reporting**, create **test plans**, and use **JIRA issue simulation**.  
2. **Day 4–5**: Begin API automation with **Postman scripting** and explore **Selenium** setup.  
3. **Day 6–7**: Implement a basic **Playwright or Selenium test**, and polish repo for job applications.

## 🛠️ How to Use

- Browse **`manual-tests/`** to see test case examples and QA organization.  
- Import the `.postman_collection.json` file into Postman to review or re-run API tests.  
- Watch this space — automated tests will go into `automation-tests/` soon.
